- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Your Next-Auth secret that needs to be secure. You can generate it by following the command

```sh
openssl rand hex -32

- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your project's local or public URL. If your project is in development mode then use `http://localhost:PORT`, but if your project is in production mode, then add your project's public URL
